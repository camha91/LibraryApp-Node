Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby was first published on April 10, 1925. Set on Long Island’s North Shore and in New York City during the summer of 1922, it is the story of an attractive young man, hopelessly in love, who, having worked so hard to improve himself so he can win back the woman he loves, finds himself in a world where money has replaced humility and despair has replaced hope. For me, the novel is a comment on the values and cynicism of east coast America almost a hundred years ago, a time when a section of society had suddenly become very wealthy and the American Dream was for most, nothing more than the mere pursuit of money.’ Peter Joucla ‘Peter Joucla’s surprisingly clear-eyed adaptation cuts to the heart of Fitzgerald’s text while preserving a very decent amount of it.’ 4 stars –Evening Standard ‘Evoking all the glamour and atmosphere of the roaring twenties, Wilton’s brings Gatsby to glorious, all-singing, all-dancing life (jazz hands optional). A must-see’ – welovethisbook.com ‘An unashamed nostalgia party for a world we never knew... This is a show that majors in fun; and it’s no surprise to see it’s a cult hit.’ Telegraph"}
